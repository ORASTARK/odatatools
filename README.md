## Contribution

I created this extensions to fill my need using this with our oData services (ASP.NET oData V4.0). I tested it against the northwind service. I will extend this in the future, if I have any need to get things done. So please file an issue on github, I will have a look at it, how much work it will be to extend this. Or fork it and extend it on your own. Contribution is always welcome.
